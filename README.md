# Summary
A plugin for [Renoise](https://www.renoise.com) that creates a group of three groups, configured such that the first group has two Signal Followers which point to the second and third groups. Activity in the first group ducks the second group's volume and boosts the third group's volume.

# Usage
`Tools > New duckerbooster`.

You can also optionally bind that behavior to a key by navigating to the keybinding setup menu at `Preferences > Keys` and configuring `Pattern Editor > Track Control > New duckerbooster`.

# References
[Renoise's scripting docs](https://files.renoise.com/xrnx/documentation/) were super helpful in making this.
